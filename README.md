## Machine-Learning-From-Scratch
### Easy  implementations  of ML algorithm in Python code from scratch.

I have created this repository solely for learners, who often struggle to find Machine Learning Algorithms explained in simple and implemented from scratch.
I haven’t used Scikit-Learn or any other advanced ML library.  Understanding underlying Mathematics and Algorithm is must for any Machine Learning 
Practicenor /Enthusiast. Keeping that in my mind I have implement all the classical M.L. Algorithm suing Python, NumPy and a little bit of Pandas. 
I have included slides explanation notes as much possible. This repository is still under construction but I am continuously working on it and you will  
find it complete soon. Following are the topics and I believe reader should learn in this given order of precedence (at least while learning for the first time). 

#### 1) Linear Regression with Gradient Descent
#### 2) Logistic Regression (Linear/Non-Linear Decision Boundary)
#### 3) Softmax Regression for Multiclass Classification
#### 4) Generative Approach to Classification & Naïve Bayes
#### 5) KNN
#### 6) Kmeans -Clustering
#### 7) Decision Tree
#### 8) Ensemble Learning and Random Foreset
#### 9) Ada-Boost, XG-Boost, Gradient Boosting
#### 10) SVM
